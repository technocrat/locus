# Why learn about logistic regression?

> Because the outcome, $Y$, is binary, rather than continous, we choose logistic regression, rather than linear regression.

Hosmer, David W., Stanley Lemeshow, and Rodney X. Sturdivant. *Applied logistic regression*. Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley, 2013, the standard text (**HLS**). This post closely follows chapter 1 of HLS, which provides no code, by providing illustrations in `R`.  n

# CHD vs. Age

Data from Table 1.1. Replicate binned summary from Table 1.2

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# omit plotting points
pander(means_tab %>% select(-plotpoint), justify = 'right', digits = 3)
```

## Replicate line graph used in place of scattergraph

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# line with points at inflections

p <- ggplot(data = means_tab, aes(x = plotpoint, y = Mean)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + xlab("Age (years)") + ylab("Coronary Heart Disease (mean)")
p
```

# ICU data from exercises

## Logistic equation of vital status (STA) on AGE at discharge

The conditional mean of Y (SNA) given x (AGE) is 

$$ E(Y|X) $$

which is conventionally expressed as

$$ \pi(x) $$
The form of the logistic model of $\pi(x)$ is

$$\pi(x) = \frac{e^{\beta{_0}+\beta{_1}x}}{1 + e^{\beta{_0}+\beta{_1}x}}$$ 

The *logit tranformation* is defined as

$$g(x) = ln\Bigl[\frac{\pi(x)}{1 - \pi(x)}\Big] = \beta_0 +\beta_1x$$

Because the outcome, $Y$, is binary, rather than continous, we choose logistic regression, rather than linear regression.

## Scatterplot

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
icu <- read_tsv("../data/ICU/ICU.txt")
p <- ggplot(data = icu, aes(x = AGE, y = STA)) + geom_point() + theme_tufte()
p
```

## Scatterplot and cohort table

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- icu
df <- df %>% mutate(cohort = ifelse(AGE >= 15 & AGE <= 24,1, 1))
df <- df %>% mutate(cohort = ifelse(AGE >= 30 & AGE <= 34,2, cohort))
df <- df %>% mutate(cohort = ifelse(AGE >= 35 & AGE <= 39,3, cohort))
df <- df %>% mutate(cohort = ifelse(AGE >= 40 & AGE <= 54,4, cohort))
df <- df %>% mutate(cohort = ifelse(AGE >= 54 & AGE <= 64,5, cohort))
df <- df %>% mutate(cohort = ifelse(AGE >= 65 & AGE <= 74,6, cohort))
df <- df %>% mutate(cohort = ifelse(AGE >= 75 & AGE <= 84,7, cohort))
df <- df %>% mutate(cohort = ifelse(AGE >= 85 & AGE <= 94,8, cohort))

df <- df %>% mutate(plotpoint = ifelse(cohort == 1,19.5, 0))
df <- df %>% mutate(plotpoint = ifelse(cohort == 2,29.5, plotpoint))
df <- df %>% mutate(plotpoint = ifelse(cohort == 3,39.5, plotpoint))
df <- df %>% mutate(plotpoint = ifelse(cohort == 4,49.5, plotpoint))
df <- df %>% mutate(plotpoint = ifelse(cohort == 5,59.5, plotpoint))
df <- df %>% mutate(plotpoint = ifelse(cohort == 6,69.5, plotpoint))
df <- df %>% mutate(plotpoint = ifelse(cohort == 7,79.5, plotpoint))
df <- df %>% mutate(plotpoint = ifelse(cohort == 8,89.5, plotpoint))

df <- df %>% mutate(AgeGroup = ifelse(cohort == 1,"15-24", 0))
df <- df %>% mutate(AgeGroup = ifelse(cohort == 2,"25-34", AgeGroup))
df <- df %>% mutate(AgeGroup = ifelse(cohort == 3,"35-44", AgeGroup))
df <- df %>% mutate(AgeGroup = ifelse(cohort == 4,"55-64", AgeGroup))
df <- df %>% mutate(AgeGroup = ifelse(cohort == 5,"65-74", AgeGroup))
df <- df %>% mutate(AgeGroup = ifelse(cohort == 6,"75-84", AgeGroup))
df <- df %>% mutate(AgeGroup = ifelse(cohort == 7,"75-84", AgeGroup))
df <- df %>% mutate(AgeGroup = ifelse(cohort == 8,"85-94", AgeGroup))

df <- df %>% mutate(Dead  = ifelse(STA == 0,0,1))
df <- df %>% mutate(Lived = ifelse(STA == 1,1,0))

means <- df %>% group_by(cohort) %>% summarize(Mean = mean(STA), plotpoint = mean(plotpoint))
means_tab <- df %>% group_by(AgeGroup) %>%  summarize(n = n(), Died = sum(Dead), Lived = sum(Lived), Mean = mean(STA), plotpoint = mean(plotpoint)) %>% ungroup()
pander(means_tab %>% select(-plotpoint), justify = 'right', digits = 3)
```

Replicate line graph used in place of scatterplot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(data = means, aes(x = plotpoint, y = Mean))
p + geom_line() + xlim(15,95) + geom_point() + xlab("Age") + ylab("Mean Dead") + theme_tufte()
```

## Likelihood and log likelihood

$$l\beta = \prod_{i = 1}^n\pi(x)^{y_i}[1 - \pi(x)]^{1-y_i}, n = 200$$


$$L(\beta) = ln[l(\beta)] = \prod_{i = 1}^n{y, ln[\pi(x_i)]), ln[1 - \pi(x_i)]}$$

## Likelihood estimates

To find $\beta$ that maximizes $L(\beta)$, we cannot differentiate the sum of squared deviation functions with repect to $\beta$ because they are not linear.
