      <description>There is a whole sub-culture of food porn, the lavish coffee table books that set out to educate you to an entire culture through its food. I once saw a library of several hundred.
These are page flippers – doesn’t that look marvelous, we’ll have to try it next time we find halibut cheeks. The sad fact, though, is that any of these books are lucky if the owner actually uses one or two of its recipes and exalted if a recipe becomes a dinner party staple.</description>
