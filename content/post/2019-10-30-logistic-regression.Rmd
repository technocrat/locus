# Why learn about logistic regression?

> Because the outcome, $Y$, is binary, rather than continous, we choose logistic regression, rather than linear regression.

Hosmer, David W., Stanley Lemeshow, and Rodney X. Sturdivant. *Applied logistic regression*. Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley, 2013, the standard text (**HLS**).

# HSL doesn't have code examples, but it does have exercises

My plan is to work the exercises in `R` and to post the results here, with the scripts available on `git.`

# Also in preparation

Along side those planned posts is a mini-primer to walk through a real-world dataset.
