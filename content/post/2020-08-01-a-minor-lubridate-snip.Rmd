```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Dates can be fussy. (Especially when they come to you mangled by manual formatting in spreadsheets.)

Sometimes it's easier, when there are consecutive dates, simply to create them with `seq`. For `ts`, don't even bother, just use `object <- ts(source, start = c(2018,1 ) ...)`

The `date` can be unpacked multiple ways to make presentation easier. Here's what can be done with days of the week.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lubridate))
seq(c(ISOdate(2020,7,19)), by = "day", length.out = 7) -> the_days

wday(the_days)
wday(the_days, label = TRUE)
wday(the_days, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
# locale argument is OS specific
wday(the_days, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE, locale = "fr_FR.utf8")
```
