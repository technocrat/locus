```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Dates can be fussy. (Especially when they come to you mangled by manual formatting in spreadsheets.)

Sometimes, it's easier, when there are consecutive dates, it's simply easier to create them with `seq`. For `ts`, don't even bother, just use `object <- ts(source, start = c(2018,1 ) ...)`

The `date` can be unpacked multiple ways to make presentation easier. Here's what can be done with days of the week.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lubridate))
seq(c(ISOdate(2020,7,19)), by = "day", length.out = 7) -> the_days

wday(the_days)
wday(the_days, label = TRUE)
wday(the_days, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
# locale argument is OS specific
wday(the_days, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE, locale = "fr_FR.utf8")
```
