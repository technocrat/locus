[Woody Hayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Hayes) was supposed to have run up the score 42-12 late in the third quarter and went for a two-point conversion, shortly before the clock ran out. Asked why, he was said to have answered

> There are no 3-point conversions!

In the same spirit, I posted [the other day](https://technocrat.rbind.io/2019/12/30/not-even-wrong/) about a tweet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;There is no bubble&quot;<br><br>via DB <a href="https://t.co/MnMSpE38q2">pic.twitter.com/MnMSpE38q2</a></p>&mdash; Daniel Lacalle (@dlacalle_IA) <a href="https://twitter.com/dlacalle_IA/status/1211682959994081280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 30, 2019</a></blockquote>

propagating a plot was attributed to Deutche Bank Research purporting to show a linear regression of the weekly change in Federal Reserve Bank assets against the weekly change in the S&P Index.

I ran the model with data from [Fred](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) for the paltry number of weeks in 2019Q4.

For snicks, I'm now taking a look at $n = 52$, the entire year.

If [Deutche Bank Research's mission statement](https://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/RPS_EN-PROD/Our_mission/RPS_MISSION.alias)

> Deutsche Bank Research delivers high-quality, independent analysis and actively promotes public debate on economic, fiscal, labour market and social policy issues.

is a an accurate reflection of the plot in the original tweet, then obviously its attribution was in error. On the other hand ... . Alternatives are left as an exercise for the reader.
