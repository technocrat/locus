The plot was attributed to Deutche Bank Research.

Our ever-helpful friend [Fred](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) has two data series, `SP500_PCH` and `WALCL_PCH` that cover the same ground, but only up to 2019-12-18, the latest date for which the S&P data was available as of 2019-12-30. 

So, let's see if we can replicate the DB results:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(broom))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggthemes)) 
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(readr)) 

fed <- read_csv("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/technocrat/d2b231087f35ce987981c98ed5c90042/raw/f266d593bd33c72bcc8f1cb8c0c6415dd6e15fbb/WALCL.csv")
sp <- read_csv("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/technocrat/b93617e7574ff88ddeeb815af529b38c/raw/b9453495b2cf7a55af1ee79806477c0c896eb9f7/SP500_PCH.csv")
sp_v_fed <- inner_join(sp, fed, by = "DATE")
fit <- lm(formula = SP500_PCH ~ WALCL_PCH, data = sp_v_fed)
slope <- fit$coefficients[2]
r2 <- summary(fit)$r.squared
rsq <- paste("R squared = ",round(r2,5))
sources <- "Sources:

heading <- "Fed Balance Sheet vs S&P 500\nOct 9-Dec 18, 2019"
x_lab <- "Weekly percentage change in S&P 500 index"
y_lab <- "Weekly percentage change in Federal Reserve Bank assets"
p <- ggplot(sp_v_fed, aes(SP500_PCH, WALCL_PCH))
my_model_plot <- p + geom_point() + geom_abline(slope = slope) + annotate("text", x = 0.15, y = -0.6, label = sources, hjust = 0) + annotate("text", x = -0.25, y = -0.75, label = rsq) + labs(x = x_lab, y = y_lab) + theme_economist() + ggtitle(heading)
```

What we used to call a `wire house` (albeit one whose affiliate is known to have made poorly secured real estate loans) is right and your blogger is wrong, or *v.v*. or both. One of them may also be `bullshit`, a proposition offered, according to the philospher [Harry Frankfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Frankfurt) not for its truth but simply to influence. *See* [On Bullshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit).

The only way to tell, is by the maxim of St. Ronald `доверяй, но проверяй` by one's own replication. After all, it's hard to exclude the possibility that neither model is well-formed, and, more importantly, that neither may be particularly useful as an insight.

It's also worth taking a look at the `p-value` of the `F-statistic` for my model: `r round(glance(fit)$statistic, 3)` -- not even close to the $\alpha = 0.05$ laugh test.
