# Where does this dataset come from?

> Is this the original revised data or the revised revised data?

Keeping track of the provenance of data can be a challenge, especially when drawing on published sources. Keeping a record of the origin, the date accessed, the transformations applied (e.g., converting from .xls to cvs and converting character strings such as “$1,250,321.21” to floats or date strings to date objects), subsequent changes, who handled the data object and where it can be found in a repository are all things that enhance the analyst’s own ability to reproduce results.

Unfortunately, notes go missing, files get mis-filed and all the other hazards that can befall research can happen. Often, one wishes for R objects with built-in metadata for that purpose.

# Using mostattributes() to do attach metadata

Scott Chamerlain at ropensci.org brought **attr* to my attention, which is the built-in way I was looking for originally. He also pointed me to EML, a much more elaborate approach suited for publication projects.

## A minimal example

### Create data frame and a separate metadata list

```{r, results="asis", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fips <- read.csv("https://tuva.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/state_fips_postal.csv", header = FALSE)
    colnames(fips) = c("state", "fip", 'id')
    require(jsonlite) # easier to use JSON to write metadata
    meta <- fromJSON("https://tuva.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2015-07-31-meta.json")
```

    fips <- read.csv("https://tuva.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/state_fips_postal.csv", header = FALSE)
    colnames(fips) = c("state", "fip", 'id')
    require(jsonlite) # easier to use JSON to write metadata
    meta <- fromJSON("https://tuva.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2015-07-31-meta.json")

`r pander(meta)`

### Associate the metadata with the data frame using attr

    # invisibly with attr
    x <- fips
    attr(x, "meta") <- meta

```{r, results="asis", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    x <- fips
    attr(x, "meta") <- meta
``` 

### By default, metadata is not displayed

`r pander(x)`

### Metadata has to be invoked by name

    attr(x, "meta")

`r pander(attr(x, "meta"))`

### Associate the metadata with the data frame using mostattributes

```{r, results="asis", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
x <- fips
mostattributes(x) <- list(meta = meta)
```

    x <- fips
    mostattributes(x) <- list(meta = meta)

### The metadata now displays with the data frame

    str(x)

`r pander(str(x))`
